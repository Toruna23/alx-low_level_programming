#Function, nested loops 

Project done during **Full stack software engineering studies** at **Alx school**. It aims to learn abou header files functions, loops and nested loops in **c language**.

##Technologies 
* C files are compiled using 'gcc 4.8.4'
* C file are written according to te C90 standard
